                When I first saw my friend Jusung Kim's work on Instagram, I knew right away that I wanted to make a website for him. 
                
                It was the perfect opportunity to improve my website building skills and add professionality to Jusung's Instagram account.
                
                Through this collaboration, I was able to gain hands-on experience of how interaction between a developer/designer
                and a content creator would work.

                In his Instagram, Jusung writes and draws about his daily life. This type of comic is often refered as 'Daily Toon' in Korea. 
                
                He also runs another Instragram account where he draws from famous actors to animation characters with his own palette. 

                In the future, we plan to think of ways to monetize the contents on Jusung's Instagram.

                This is my first project I have conducted as a team leader.

                It started out as a mini project between me and Dong Hwan Jung in February 2021. 

                However, we soon realized the potential of the application and recruited two more members, a designer and marketer, to expand our project.

                My roles are team leader, main developer, sub designer, and sub marketer. 

                As the team leader, I am responsible for writing documentation for our team notion page and configuring our slack channel. 

                As the main developer, I write tasks and review code for our other developer, Dong Hwan. I also take the time to development myself as well. 

                As the sub designer and sub marketer, I discuss the direction of our application and what aspects should be looked upon on our application.

                Overall, I bridge the three different sections and hold them together.

                I have and am learning tremendously through this project not only in terms of developement but what it takes to become a leader.

                We are estimating the end of Q4 of 2021 to be our release date.

                You can learn more about our team and the application we are building down below in our recruitment page.

                My former battle buddy and current photographer/videographer, I have known Yohan Lee for more than 4 years now.
                Prominent as "Hantastic Lee" on Instagram, he currently runs a successful photography and videography Instragram about his travels around the world.
                I had the opportunity to take part in several of his travels and we plan to do more traveling together in the future.

                As I started web development, I wanted to practice making actual websites that would be beneficial to the people around me.
                
                Making a website for Yohan was the perfect way to do so and we collaborated right away.

                He provided me the content to work with while I was in charge of the technology behind the website.  

                We are planning to make business plans to monetize his works. 

                You can check out his work at [hantastic.lee](https://www.instagram.com/hantastic.lee/).
