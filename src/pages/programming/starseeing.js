                This is my first project I have conducted as a team leader.

                It started out as a mini project between me and Dong Hwan Jung in February 2021. 

                However, we soon realized the potential of the application and recruited two more members, a designer and marketer, to expand our project.

                My roles are team leader, main developer, sub designer, and sub marketer. 

                As the team leader, I am responsible for writing documentation for our team notion page and configuring our slack channel. 

                As the main developer, I write tasks and review code for our other developer, Dong Hwan. I also take the time to development myself as well. 

                As the sub designer and sub marketer, I discuss the direction of our application and what aspects should be looked upon on our application.

                Overall, I bridge the three different sections and hold them together.

                I have and am learning tremendously through this project not only in terms of developement but what it takes to become a leader.

                We are estimating the end of Q4 of 2021 to be our release date.

                You can learn more about our team and the application we are building down below in our recruitment page.
