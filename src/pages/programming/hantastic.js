            My former battle buddy and current photographer/videographer, I have known Yohan Lee for more than 4 years now.
            Prominent as "Hantastic Lee" on Instagram, he currently runs a successful photography and videography Instragram about his travels around the world.
            I had the opportunity to take part in several of his travels and we plan to do more traveling together in the future.

            As I started web development, I wanted to practice making actual websites that would be beneficial to the people around me.
            
            Making a website for Yohan was the perfect way to do so and we collaborated right away.

            He provided me the content to work with while I was in charge of the technology behind the website.  

            We are planning to make business plans to monetize his works. 

            You can check out his work at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hantastic.lee/">Hantastic Lee</a>
